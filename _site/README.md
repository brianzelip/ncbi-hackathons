# NCBI Hackathons Github Page!

https://ncbi-hackathons.github.io/

**Changelog**
- Brian Zelip updated this site during the June 19-21, 2017 NYGC Hackathon.
- This site is now a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, which is automatically compiled via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
- It now contains some modularity, namely:
  - the html files in `_layouts/`
  - the html files in `_includes/`
  - the data files in `_data/`
  - the front matter metadata in `pages/*.md`
- Some atomic css was brought in for the purposes of quickly scaffolding out an updated site (as well as better css organization, but that's another story). See the comment toward the middle of `css/custom.css` for more info.
- To update the hackathon products or upcoming hackathon dates, edit the files in `_data/`.
- Possible workflows for updating this site:
  - via GitHub.com in a web browser
  - via a text editor on a computer with a git connection to the remote repo
  - via a computer with jekyll and git, etc.
