# Question
How does the NCBI-Hackathons GitHub organization work?
  - https://github.com/orgs/NCBI-Hackathons/people
  - "This organization has no public members"

# Action Items

## Add brianzelip to NCBI-Hackathons GitHub organization

## Start a new ncbi-hackathons.github.io repo from scratch for contribution attribution sake (eventually); archive the current repo by renaming it

## Let new hackathon event folks know how to equip their project repo to be included on the site, https://gist.github.com/brianzelip/34c7ae7fae90122c45d624fb20aa670b

TODOs:
1. Make the default list rendered in ascending order by `updatedAt`.
2. Add the ability to filter repos by:
  - primaryLanguage
  - other (new) GitHub repo tags (categories)
